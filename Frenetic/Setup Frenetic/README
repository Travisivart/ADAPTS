Steps to run on the controller (The controller must be publicly routable, because if it is connected to the switch,
the switch will not allow traffic through to it during the inistal setup phases, meaning that we can't finish the setup):

Run the install:
frenetic_install.sh - Installs everything you need to run and test frenetic_install

To run a test in three seperate shell windows run them in this order:
frenetic.sh - Starts up frenetic

repeater.sh - Runs the repeater script which just takes all data coming in all ports and sends it out all ports

Run on the switch itself (with minor modifications to the script to set the appropriate ethX ports and the ip of the controller)
install_switch.sh
